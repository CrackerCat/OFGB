## Other Notes
- Thanks for checking out the project, and for all of the support! ❤️

- GitHub is the only place I am sharing this program! I would strongly caution against using other sites like uptodown or the like. I DO NOT HAVE CONTROL OF, AND CAN NOT VERIFY THE SAFETY OF THE APP IF YOU DOWNLOAD OFGB FROM SOME OTHER RANDOM SITE BESIDES GITHUB.
